**Background** 
- Beauty industry is very broad. It encompasses cosmetics, perfume, products for skin and hair care. Worldwide sales of beauty-related products and services are estimated to be in excess of $159 billion US dollars (USD) each year. 
- French beauty retailer, Sephora, created a new shopping experience for consumers, who had an additional choice beyond going to the mall or purchasing beauty products at a pharmacy or supermarket. They significantly provided products at different price points, from elite brands to store own labels. The Clean at Sephora category only contains products that are free from over 50 questionable ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, formaldehyde, and more. Fragrance brands must also be cruelty-free, meaning that they do not test on, harm or kill animals in the making of their products. 
- There’s a reason that the clean beauty industry keeps gaining speed, and it’s because as time goes on and people become more informed about harmful and toxic ingredients, it becomes more and more clear how necessary natural products are.
